Groot is a command line application with the purpose of remote managing AWS ECS Clusters and
 their associated resources (Tasks, Instances, Services, etc.)

## Installing

You will need `cabal-install` installed in your system, you either get it by installing the package using your favourite
 package manager or installing the Haskell Platform. Once you have it, just run:

```bash
cabal install groot
```

## Building From Source

You will need [Stack](http://haskellstack.org) installed in your local machine. Once youÂ´ve got that, then clone this
 repository and install the binaries using Stack:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alonsodomin/groot
cd groot
stack install
```

Now step back, the whole of The Internet is going to be sucked into your machine.

## First Steps

Now that you have it installed in your system, run it with the `-h` (or `--help`) command line
 option to get an idea of what you can do.

```bash
groot -h
```

Groot supports several sub-commands, use the same `-h` flag to get some help on what they can do,
 i.e.: `groot ls tasks -h`.

## Interactive Shell

There is also the option of running in an interactive shell, run the `groot shell` command and you'll see a welcome message and the prompt:

```bash
Welcome to the Groot Shell.
Type 'help' for a list of available commands
groot>
```

Enter `exit` to get back to your main shell. All the other commands available from the command line are also available in the shell session.

## Status

Groot is a toy project started to solve the need for a proper tool to perform my most rutinary
 tasks when managing ECS resources.

Don't expect here the best Haskell code (and I should probably write more tests), if it serves
 you then great, use it and feel free to contribute.
