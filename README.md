# Groot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alonsodomin/groot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alonsodomin/groot)

Groot is a command line application with the purpose of remote managing AWS ECS Clusters and
 their associated resources (Tasks, Instances, Services, etc.)

## Getting Started

You will need [Stack](http://haskellstack.org) installed in your local machine. Once youÂ´ve got that, then clone this
 repository and install the binaries using Stack:

```
git clone https://github.com/alonsodomin/groot
cd groot
stack install
```

Now that you have it installed in your system, run it with the `-h` (or `--help`) command line
 option to get an idea of what you can do.

```
groot -h
```

Groot supports several sub-commands, use the same `-h` flag to get some help on what they can do,
 i.e.: `groot ls tasks -h`.

## Status

Groot is a toy project started to further my knowledge of the Haskell programming language
 at the same time that I was solving a need for a proper tool to perform my most rutinary
 tasks when managing ECS resources.

Don't expect here the best Haskell code (and I should probably write more tests), if it serves
 you then great, use it and feel free to contribute.
